\title{A MetaTOpathway Function}
\usage{
MetaTOpathway(q.type, hmdb = T, pubchem = T, chebi = F, kegg = T, metlin = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{q.type}{The type of the metabolites id such as 'name', 'kegg', 'hmdb','pubchem'}
}
\description{
This function allows you to convert your metabolites id such as names, kegg ids, pubchem ids.
into pathways. Metabolites which have not pathways will be excluded from any downstream analysis
make sure that you have three database files which are used for exact and fuzzy matching:
cmpd_db.rda, syn_nms_db.rda and Sijia_pathway.rda
