Description: A comprehensive analysis tool for metabolomics data.  It consists a variety of functional modules, including It also has several new modules, including a pre-processing module for normalization and imputation, an exploratory data analysis module for dimension reduction and source of variation analysis, a classification module with the new deep-learning method and other machine-learning methods, a prognosis module with cox-PH and neural-network based Cox-nnet methods, and pathway analysis module to visualize the pathway and interpret metabolite-pathway relationships.
